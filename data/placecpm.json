But, after an easy install and a quick set up with some great help from PlaceCPM because of our unusual process, we quickly found out what a valuable tool this is for a small business like ours.\n\nWhen you are a small business, cash is king, and knowing when and where you are going to need cash, where it is coming from was very revealing. We quickly could make adjustments for future business.  So Long complicated spreadsheets!\n\nOur CFO said &quot;I wish I had this years ago&quot;.\n\nThe reports are great. They are simple to make and so easy to drill down into the nitty gritty to see what is really going on in detail.\n\nAll in all, it has already paid for the investment in Place…."

Our financial data were scattered around and it took quite a while to segregate and build a forecast model. That is until Place CPM came along.\n\nNow with the power to seamlessly create P&amp;L forecast and see them as a consolidated report, we were able to sort out our accounts clearly. It gives us a one-stop portal to view all our numbers and helps us in growing our business. Highly recommend this for all organizations looking to upscale and simplify their financial forecasting models with no hassle at all."

A real quick, accurate and easy sync up with our existing Salesforce platform made it more efficient for us to manage our day-to-day transaction based financials. Our workflows have become much easier in order to deal with cash projections and P&amp;L forecasting. We don’t have to worry about data silos or time consuming spreadsheets anymore.\n\nWe do transactions in foreign currencies as well. With the help of Place CPM, we are now able to distinguish between the various currencies and keep up with quick consolidations. It enabled us to utilize the wealth of our financial and operational data to maximize our business insights. I’d definitely recommend it to companies who need financial forecasting at their fingertips!"

So I never have enough time to devote to financial projections and my background is as an engineer, not in finance.  The things I like most about PlaceCPM are:\n1. It was super easy and fast to set up, no expensive implementation!!! (I was worried about this.)\n2. It does P&amp;L forecast but also does CASH! This was impossible to find before I found CPM.\n3. Helps me see what is really going on with all of our accounts.\n4. Love the cool way it automatically forecasts and adds the expenses that increase when I hire someone new.\n5. We are raising our next round  of investment and it enabled me to get my financials up to speed without needing to hire a CFO. Essentially CPM paid for itself within the first 30 days. \n6. I think it would be worth moving to Salesforce so you can use CPM if you aren&#39;t already on SF."
