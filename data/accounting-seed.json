The product continues to evolve and improve and we look for more ways to leverage the complete platform to more of our user base. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."

It kind of made accounting seem fun to me lol anyways I would recommend to anyone using Salesforce with 3rd party financial software."

My questions were answered quickly and fully, I was never made to feel like I was asking too much of her time and she was always a pleasure to work with. In the nonprofit community, sometimes organizations like mine are treated as less valuable than a large corporation, this was not the case with Elle and Accounting Seed. We were treated with the utmost respect and like our business was highly coveted. Elle made sure we understood the product fully, what kind of support we would need, how Accounting Seed was an awesome fit for us, and how it will grow with us into the future. I cannot brag enough about the wonderful experience we had with Accounting Seed. Thank you Elle for all of your hard work and help! I truly felt like I was speaking to a good friend every time we emailed back and forth or met via video chat. Thank you for treating us with such kindness and respect and making sure that we could make an informed decision about Accounting Seed. Elle, you are one in a million. Thank you!"

We decided on Accounting Seed for its functionality, capabilities and direct integration with Salesforce (something other accounting softwares did not offer). From the implementation team, to the training, and the support - Accounting Seed has been nothing short of fantastic! The system is easy to use (there is definitely a learning curve, but once you get that - it&#39;s 123) and incredibly robust - I still think we are learning new things about its capabilities in relation to our business every day. I am now looking at bringing our other company on to Accounting Seed as well to streamline all of our processes between two companies and maximize our efficiency going forward. It is a powerful system and each release update improves its ease of use and overall user experience - it is clearly created with the end user in mind and it makes all the difference!"

We&#39;ve been using Accounting Seed since January 2018. The products we build onsite each have a bill-of-materials containing 100+ parts and we need to track thousands of components and assemblies in our inventory system. Doing this with an external accounting system with custom integrations became untenable (inaccurate count, missing parts, out of sync information, etc).  Accounting Seed has allowed us to consolidate all of our engineering, production, and procurement information into a single database, free of sync errors and clumsy integrations. With all our data in one place, we developed a robust business management system that provides greater visibility of critical information to everyone in the organization. \n\nAccounting Seed can be customized as easily as any other aspects of SalesForce, allowing you to rethink what your accounting system can do for you. If you need to manage materials accurately and have instant access to inventory balances to support a manufacturing operation within SalesForce, you need Accounting Seed.  It&#39;s an excellent product, constantly improving, and backed by a team dedicated to your success."

The flexibility we&#39;ve had with this system has been a great benefit."

Our decision to move to Accounting Seed was a great one for our business.  We\u2019ve created so many efficiencies, we\u2019ve been able to harness the power of the data inside Salesforce. We\u2019re able to bring that information alive and share it with our customers to benefit all of us. We\u2019re so much more process-oriented using Accounting Seed.  Accounting Seed gives us the ability to grow by giving us information towards our strategic plan. We understand the value of a partner or a customer with the power of Accounting Seed and the CRM, we\u2019re able to determine the best way to move forward to help them grow their business.\nThe native Accounting Seed reporting is great, but there is also the ability to customize reporting to our needs.  Customer support is very responsive and knowledgeable.  Regular upgrades that continue to provide continually better functionality."

Given COVID-19, we are fast-tracking the launch.  We needed something Native on Salesforce so that it leverages the security we get with Salesforce given data sensitivity. In addition, we needed something fast in order to hit launch timelines for our first hospital (a top tier New England hospital). Integration to our current NetSuite financial system used for our consulting business was going to take too long.. so it jeopardized the launch timeline.  We evaluated options and Accounting Seed was responsive and agile.  E***, our account executive, seemed to get the mission of what we were trying to accomplish and mobilized to help us achieve it. While we were weeding through the ladder of salespeople at other options, she had implementation experience and was able to help us solution, price, and plan for the implementation.  It was refreshing to have someone knowledgeable, helpful, and aligned to our mission. We have an amazing mission to deliver something helpful to patients and nonprofits in a short timeframe, but it takes our vendor partners to rally in order to help us do that. No one has ever executed a big idea that truly transforms an industry alone.  We needed help and Accounting Seed stepped up to the plate."

We moved from Hubspot/Quickbooks with the vision of having a unified system that could leverage automation and make our internal systems more scalable. Accounting Seed has accomplished everything we wanted and more. The Inventory system allows us to manage our kits and bundles built in CPQ with ease. The procurement process has become significantly streamlined. All of our financial reporting is available right alongside our sales reporting. This tool has also virtually eliminated our need for duplicate entry. \n\nOutside of the features/functionality, I couldn\u2019t be more impressed with the service we have received from Account Seed. With any Accounting system transition, there are bound to be urgent issues that come up along the way. Our primary contact, Chris Johannes, has been incredible. Super responsive and very knowledgable. Every time we\u2019ve had something business impacting, Chris has never hesitated to jump right in and fix it quickly. He\u2019s even worked long after business hours for us when the issue was urgent. \n\nIf you are considering a move off of your existing ERP, and you use or are planning to purchase Salesforce, do yourself a favor and consider Accounting Seed. You\u2019ll be glad you did."

									"response": "This review is written from a Salesforce Admin perspective, not an Accounting perspective. I want to point out a few drawbacks that we encounter on a continuous basis that I wish we were aware of from the launch. \n1) Storage Usage - depending on the number of transactions being processed, this can rack up to be a lot. Additional storage from Salesforce is expensive so don&#39;t overlook this. Archiving is available, but only on the Transaction/Cube object. \n2) Releases introduce issues - since we have customized our instance to automate a lot of transactions (cash receipts, billings, cash disbursements, credit memos etc.) using apex, each Accounting Seed release is a nightmare because many of our unit tests start to fail because of new business logic rules were introduced. \n3) Mediocre Support - they provide very basic support and anything beyond that, they recommend a third party partner. \n4) Not very user-friendly - our Accounting team has had a difficult time adapting to Accounting Seed. This is probably the result of building an Accounting product on the Force.com platform, but nonetheless, it&#39;s not an intuitive product to use.  \nHowever, despite all of the above, it&#39;s still a powerful accounting product that we have come to rely on and accept it&#39;s faults, at least for the time being."

The app itself is native to Salesforce and thus heavily customizable for your business process. The Accounting Seed workflow connects seamlessly with your standard sales cloud / service cloud objects and provides a number of customizable features to fit any vertical from professional services to manufacturing. The app supports companies with multi-currency enabled and multi-ledger accounting. \n\nMy one big recommendation is to prepare your app as you would a full accounting suite implementation, as every change should be reviewed with Salesforce AND Accounting best practices in mind. I highly recommend an implementation partner OR at least a few hours of technical support with accounting seed and a highly skilled Salesforce admin prior to implementation."

That day to day Tier 3 Support support is key to keeping clients on course.\n\nVRP has committed to expand support beyond North America for the Accounting Seed platform in EMEA through investing in our personnel and retraining Sage Financials professionals in the Accounting Seed environment.\n\nThe accounting field is black or white, debit or credit and the advanced functionality that Accounting Seed provides with the native Salesforce integration in my opinion makes it a clear financial decision to avoid an expensive Netsuite implementation and integration!"

We went live this year, and I have slowly added our own automation using the Salesforce tools to make our lives easier(Process Builder, Flow).  What went from a very lengthy process is now down to hours.  I also love that we can create our own dashboards and reporting using salesforce.  \n\nOne other thing to mention is that we are using Project modules.  We love this as well as we can do project costing against our projects, and see real ROI!  \n\nWe also implemented Stripe for credit card payment which was very easy.  We&#39;re in the process now of a MyPayroll Implementation that works with Accounting Seed.  \n\nLastly, the product team is amazing with great releases and a knowledge base associated with new features/functionality.  Their support documentation is great overall! \n\nThank you, and we look forward to growing with your product!"

There have been some ups and downs getting the system to work as needed.  We are still learning as we go about the quirks with Accounting Seed; such as closing a Sales Order once invoiced, closing a Purchase Order when invoiced.  That being said, Mitch Gerwin in Support has been there with us every step of the way.   He&#39;s been extremely helpful.\n\nI admit the Knowledge Base isn&#39;t too helpful, however, I have submitted support tickets and the response time is fantastic.  The instructions provided with the support tickets has been a great way to learn the new system.\n\nReconciliations are very easy in Accounting Seed.  I think one of my most favorite features is being able to Clone Journal Entries.  We do the same ones each month, with different amounts, so this feature definitely saves us time.\n\nI would recommend Accounting Seed, however, know what you want/need from an Accounting System before making a choice.  Not just with Accounting Seed, with any accounting system."

AS support along with their quickness to reply to problems make them one of the best accounting programs I have worked with."

The great part about Accounting Seed is that it can be customized to fit how we operate in our accounting department. It is easy to use once you navigate the platform and figure out where all the functions are. There are some quirks with it that bother some of us, most notably, that it isn&#39;t as user-friendly as the more basic Accounting software like QuickBooks or Sage 50. Overall, it seems like a good platform for a company of our size."

We were previously using QuickBooks and wanted something that would reduce redundancy and operate more efficiently. Accounting seed gives us that ability to be fully integrated, as we can now have billings generated straight from orders entered either online or by our sales staff. The software is evolving so you will have some wants and desires in the tech savviness and interface, but overall I have been impressed with accounting seed&#39;s ease of use and ability to address customers requests with the new releases. \n\nThe support staff has been great, when you sign up for the implementation and on-boarding, you will get personal sessions and assistance from one of accounting seed specialists. For us, that has been Mitch Gerwin, who has always gotten back to  me in a timely fashion and worked with us to ensure all our questions were answered and our needs were met. \n\nHighly recommend this as a jump from QuickBooks."

There is much to learn when you first start with AccountingSeed.  When I run into problems, I put in a support ticket and get answered right away....every time.  Their customer support is fantastic."

Since then, we have seen many upgrades with a real dedication to the quality of its products and customer service. \n\nThe software itself has improved by leaps and bounds and is an excellent fit for our business. We utilize both the Financial Suite and ERP products. \n\nI love the tremendously helpful knowledge base and refer to it pretty regularly. The newly added Accounting Seed University has been another excellent addition towards making it easy for customers to gain the knowledge needed to be a successful AS user, and if you don&#39;t find what you&#39;re looking for there, you&#39;ve always got an excellent customer service department to lean on. \n\nI can&#39;t say enough about AS&#39;s dedication to customer service. We are a small business and I wear many hats (who can relate?). I have very little time to deal with &quot;software/tech issues&quot;. My experience with customer service continues to be outstanding. They&#39;re quick to respond to questions and to resolve issues (that are usually user errors on my part). I feel like the AS team sincerely cares about my individual needs as a business and makes every effort to make resources and features a part of the program, if not already included. I&#39;ve recommended Accounting Seed many times and will continue to do so in the future."

We couldn&#39;t be happier.  This app is intuitive, effective and easy to navigate.  There are plenty of support resources and it fits our needs.  We particularly like the project accounting feature which we use for our programs.  I highly recommend Accounting Seed.  It&#39;s what we need now and has the features that we&#39;ll grow into later.  Thanks so much to Tony and his team!"

With the help of the Accounting Seed team, we were able develop a system which scans checks, matches payers against contacts and applies check funds against open invoices found within the Accounting Seed environment. You can view what we&#39;ve done with Accounting Seed objects here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSPoEyA73Fs or at http://check21.com/SalesForce-Scanning-Solutions.html.\n\nAs an FYI, our customer(s) who have transitioned from their legacy accounting platforms to Accounting Seed, could not be any happier.\n\nThank you once again Accounting Seed Team!"

									"response": "We began implementing Accounting Seed in Feb of 2015. Through some other issues internally within our company and some personnel changes, we did not end up being in a position to go live until Jan 1, 2016. We also integrated with Conga Composer and Avalara in conjunction with the product to achieve the overall look, feel and performance we were wanting(all work great together).  When we started down the path of trying to update from an industry specific package to something more streamlined our number 1 goal was to get a system that could leverage the power and data we already had in Salesforce. Accounting Seed won this category by a land slide over several significantly more expensive options we looked at. \n\nNaturally, as with any new system, the first few weeks exposed some scenarios we did not predict and a couple of relatively minor hiccups. Even though swamped by other customers implementing at the new year, I felt that our needs and issues were addressed very swiftly. On a couple of the more major ones, Tony took time out of his schedule to arrange a couple of calls to address and we were able to come up with a short term fix and have some options for longer term solutions if we deem that necessary and not incorporated in future releases. \n\nWe utilize both the Accounting and ERP and have been happy with both. The Accounting side has been commended by both our outside CPA firm and by our internal staff who were able to pick it up quite quickly due to the easy of use. The biggest struggle for new users is having an understanding of the data model and how things relate to one another. You have a lot of power if you set things up and map defaults appropriately. The ERP function has a few gotcha&#39;s that need to be looked at depending on how you cost projects out, but they seem very open to recommendations and ways to make their product better. They also worked with us to get a few work around&#39;s so our system functions correctly. \n\nHighly recommended!!"

Anytime we had an issue, the AS team was there to help, support, and resolve the problem. \n\nAll of that is almost irrelevant now that it is 2018 and we've been through multiple upgrades and improvements. The software itself has improved by leaps and bounds, a tremendously helpful knowledge base has been added, the Accounting Seed University has been developed, and my experience with customer service continues to be outstanding. I feel like the AS team sincerely cares about my individual needs as a business and makes every effort to make resources and features a part of the program, if not already included.

Accounting Seed has really improved over the last 3 years but there is not really anything we can do if the customer refuses upgrades. \n\nSpringboard Wines became a customer of Accounting Seed 4 years ago in March of 2012. To give credence to Chloe our training materials were fairly deficient at the time she signed up we also did not really understand data storage on the platform and its effects. She is correct on these 2 things. Storage costs on Salesforce is something that has been conquered in version 3.0 of Accounting Seed with archiving as well as Salesforce' new NoSQL data store. Also in 4 years our training materials and knowledgeable have also become very robust. \n\nChloe's implementation was complex. Chloe also had a pretty significant custom integration to a 3rd party logistics company written by an outside consulting company. She also went through several staffing issues with the employees she had using AS and was hit by an IRS audit. Last year Chloe reached out in a pretty bad emotional state to us for help and we responded. \n\nWhat Chloe is not sharing is that she has refused to upgrade her version of Accounting Seed. She is stuck on an early 2.0 version of our product from 3 years ago and flat out refuses to upgrade in fear of her custom integration breaking again. \n\nMost of the issues Chloe is facing have been solved in later releases of the product. We are on version 3.8 of our product now. \n\nChloe is also not sharing that Accounting Seed tried to setup weekly calls with her, provide free training and escalate her cases. She also refused additional help from us and would not participate in status meetings or form issues lists for us to jointly resolve.  \n\nIf a customer refuses to upgrade our application and won't meet with us to resolve their issues, then unfortunately there is not much we can do.",

The support documentation site is limited in scope and not very helpful.\n4) We handle a very high volume of transactions (by Accounting Seed standards) which resulted in the need for purchasing additional, very costly storage with Salesforce. We were not informed of this potential cost in advance.\n5) Accounting Seed bills itself as a &quot;native&quot; app but most of the objects are not related in a way that makes rollup summaries and other formulas possible. What would normally be a simple Salesforce admin task becomes a task for developers due to the way the system is configured.\n6) Basic features available in most accounting packages are not available with Accounting Seed: accounting must be accrual (we were told we could be cash basis before we launched), there is no Cash Flow report, there is no &quot;check register&quot;, viewing transactional data behind a line item on a report is cumbersome and confusing, the budgeting tool is difficult to navigate.\n7) Accounting Seed upgrades are not well documented which means integrations break. On multiple occasions, features that require setup changes were not communicated in advance causing issues at a later date that took hours to resolve once they were diagnosed.\n\nIn short, I have lost weeks if not months of time correcting, troubleshooting, diagnosing, undoing and redoing tasks that should be straightforward. I have spent thousands of dollars on outside help to be left with an accounting package that I have no confidence in. I would not recommend Accounting Seed.

I am happy to say that updates made by Accounting Seed in the last couple of years has made this a very powerful and stable platform. Support has been excellent. Would recommend to any SF user that wants a native 360 degree accounting package for SF.  \n\nReview Update: As we have moved forward with Accounting Seed we have discovered that the financial reporting in Accounting Seed is very limited.  The financial report formatter does not work and we have had to hire outside developers to build financial reports with Conga. If you have real time financial reporting requirements, I would evaluate this software closely to determine if it will work for you. We made the mistake of assuming that any accounting package would be able to produce real-time financial reports at least on par with Quickbooks. Not the case. As of 11/16/2015 no road map as to a solution.\n\nAccounting Seed is a killer Accounting App for the Salesforce platform. Very flexible and easy to customize. The Accounting Seed team is easy to work with and highly responsive. We have a complex recurring billing model and they have made the conversion much easier than expected. Our first attempt at Accounting within Salesforce was a complete flop. Wish we had found Accounting Seed to begin with. We are well down the road with this product. First class company. I would highly recommend."

As a native Salesforce accounting solution, it was way different than Peachtree Accounting, in which our one-man accounting team was fluent and had been a proficient user of for over a decade. My task was to migrate all our legacy data (including 2015 Peachtree records created during the cut over process), and make sure our books matched by the end of it. Needless to say, it was an exhausting process, but fortunately Accounting Seed is designed in such a way that I could fully leverage Salesforce&#39;s capabilities to manage the data easily and extend the platform with workflows way further than a non-native solution (and without external development resources). I am happy to say that our accounting guru is very happy with Accounting Seed (which is high praise indeed), and as an admin, I am excited to find more ways to make Accounting Seed work for my company.\n\nAlso, their staff is fantastic and responsive to questions and issues. AND, they are adding fantastic new features with every release."

Working with the Salesforce Marketing Cloud and Kulterra we\u2019ve streamlined our entire business. Invoices are automatically sent. Payments - including installment payments - can be scheduled. It\u2019s phenomenal. Think it\u2019s expensive? By switching to Payflow Pro (from QB), we&#39;ve saved enough money off credit card processing fees to cover the cost of our Accounting Seed licenses.  It\u2019s essentially free. Accounting Seed gave us the freedom, with minimal configuration, to do everything we wanted with our business. Am I wearing an I love Tony Zorc T-shirt? Of course I am. We&#39;re huge fans."

One key issue we had to eliminate was the clunky synchronization from SalesForce to QuickBooks.  Knowing that we had to find an accounting package that was native to SalesForce, we began the review process of all available applications.  Accounting Seed stood out immediately.  The package is enterprise enough to handle substantial growth, is easy to install, and was easily customized to meet our eCommerce business needs.  If you use QuickBooks and you sell to other businesses, then you already know the trouble you&#39;re in.  Our vision was to have a clear picture of the customer and all related parties in that account.  Once we were able to transition to running our business on SalesForce with Accounting Seed, our ability to handle accounts with multiple contacts, fill orders from multiple warehouses along with seamless drop-shipment capabilities, and have all of that baked right into SalesForce, we knew we made a genius business decision.  Thank you to Tony Zorc and the Accounting Seed team for helping us make this leap of faith."

The ability to not have to integrate a financial system and having it Force Based provides the most flexibility for any customer to truly combine Sales/Operations with the Finance/Accounting Team.  The Top criteria whenever anyone is reviewing an App to purchase should be the following:\n\n1. Flexibility to Customize - Accounting Seed is Force Based and can be customized just like anything else within Salesforce\n2. Customer Service - Accounting Seed Support Team instantaneously replies with the actual solution step-by-step\n3. No Connector or External Integration Needed - this saves clientele time and a lot of money - especially as your business grows - integrations would then need to be updated on an on-going basis.\n\nThis App is truly one of the few that is a 5 Star App.  GIT CRM has implemented this App for a number of our Clients who all have had their expectations met and most importantly surpassed after using the Accounting Seed App directly in Salesforce!"

We track pharmaceutical inventory down to the lot level, with different expiration dates on each lot.  This is not a simple process.\n\nWe chose to convert our legacy Sage/AccPac accounting/ERP system to Accounting Seed (including the ERP system).  We bought into the fact that Accounting Seed is 100% native in SalesForce.  We tested Accounting Seed for about 45 days in a test environment, and then ran in parallel From February 2015 to March 2015.  We have been running Account Seed as our Primary System since April 1st this year.  We chose the site license as our best option.  \n\nWe have been very happy with our results.  Our SalesForce adoption has gone up sky high, since all data is one place, and the opportunities to add value to customers is growing all the time as we find new ways to use the real time data all in one place.\n\nBecause we wanted to do some very unique things with our order entry, inventory transfer, and sales order process, we chose Gimbal Logic as our implementation and development partner - again, we have been very pleased with the results.  We have found the Accounting Seed with ERP plus SalesForce platform to be very straightforward to work with in adding processes to accomplish our unique business requirements, and highly scalable with our rapidly growing and changing business.\n\nWe highly recommend Accounting Seed plus ERP."

In half of the time it took us to design phase one in the other system we already in our last stages of design and deployment.

In short, we are pleased with Accounting Seed and have found it to be a very flexible solution, and with some customization it has met all of our requirements (some of which were admittedly complex).  \n\nWe use the system to manage ordering, tracking and fulfillment of approximately 1,000 POs &amp; 125 projects per month, and track all costs back to projects for job-cost accounting.  The granular security (possible due to being native on Salesforce) has allowed us to tighten up security on some key financial processes while still ensuring everyone can still perform their tasks efficiently.\n\nWorth a special mention is Accounting Seed&#39;s customer support team - which is excellent.  I believe that Accounting Seed recently increased staffing for support and it really shows.  They have been very responsive, helpful, and exceeded our expectations\u2026oh and the best part is the support is free! (Accounting Seed\u2019s free support has been significantly better than the Salesforce developers we hired\u2026who\u2019s support has been neither free nor responsive).  Post go-live support is critical (especially for Accounting/ERP), and many software suites we\u2019ve worked with in the past fell short in this area.\n\nMy only caution would be to make sure that you\u2019re very confident and comfortable with the developers you hire to setup and customize Accounting Seed.  Since one of the system\u2019s strong suits is the ability to tailor it to your business, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have a reliable partner who can support your growing needs (and their work related to the Accounting Seed solution), and provide further development as you go deeper into the possibilities that Accounting Seed provides.  As noted above, the first developers we hired fell short and didn\u2019t enable us to head down the path that we had hoped for."

Charts of accounts are easy to create, transactions from opportunities easily default to the right GL entries, and creating formatted financial reports is a simple task  - no graphic arts degree required - thankfully. Nice to eliminate the task of posting transactions into a separate system, and just have the accounting tasks happen on their own."

Historically, these have all been separate systems requiring extremely time-consuming manual reconciliation between systems.  We conducted an extensive review of software and SaaS options for meeting these needs, whether independently or as a single product set.  \n\nWe selected Accounting Seed as the center of our system.  We worked with Salesforce consulting partner Modacto to integrate Accounting Seed with project management package TaskRay.  With this system, we have everything we need in one place.  Processes that used to take hours per week are now completely automated.  Accounting Seed was extremely responsive to Modacto in helping drive this integration.\n\nAdditionally, our product sales lifecycle has been vastly improved using the Accounting Seed ERP package.  Our entire flow, from quote to sales order to purchase order to accounts receivable and payable is now in a single place, with a single flow.  This has significantly reduced the possibility for errors in this important process.\n\nThe product suite has been great, but (as others have noted), Accounting Seed really differentiates itself in customer support.  I have been a relatively high-demand user, engaging Accounting Seed regarding integrations, best practices, and feature requests.  The quality of support I&#39;ve received has been just fantastic all around. \n\nIn summary, a highly recommended tool backed by a flexible, responsive organization."

The stand out from their competition because of their attention to detail. timeliness, and outstanding customer service.  By implementing Accounting Seed they pick up great efficiencies and and visibility to profit and loss centers.  It has helped shape many decisions by providing real time data of project costs and had an immediate ROI.  If anyone is still on Quickbooks or struggling to integrate multiple cloud solutions you must try Accounting Seed because it is 100% native on the Salesforce platform.  This is a must have for distribution and light manufacturing companies"

Tony and the team have been very helpful in bringing our implementation up to speed when we needed help. For the most part, we self-implemented. Their online knowledge base was helpful enough that with a little accounting knowledge, the system became very intuitive and easy to use.

									"response": "iBOLT is a manufacturer of Smartphone accessories. The product we ultimately sell is a &quot;kit&quot; consisting of anywhere from 2 up to 10 &quot;components&quot;. \n\nWith Accounting Seed ERP (AS) we can easily keep track of  quite complicated inventory movements in a very exact way. Every time we assemble kits we &quot;build&quot; products and the AS system moves &quot;components&quot; into finished kits. Even with multiple warehouses worldwide the process is very easy and straight forward. The clever AS integration with sf.com&#39;s &quot;Products&quot; object makes the product management process quite efficient. The &quot;360 degree&quot; view on &quot;Products&quot; is truly great as every sales order, every &quot;build&quot;, every inventory movement etc. related to the product is seen on ONE page.\n\nThe 360 degree concepts extends to other parts of a business as well. For example, when we click on any &quot;Accounts&quot; the page view is set up so Sales Orders, Open Invoices, Open PO&#39;s etc are seen on the page. As we use sf.com for service Open Cases, Open Activities etc. are also seen. We also attach the latest price quote/price list to &quot;Notes &amp; Attachments&quot;. Again, the ONE page concept applies.\n\nOverall the AS package is very impressive as it is truly &quot;Salesforce native&quot;. We did not have to do any &quot;field mapping&quot; and with all standard Sf.com rules applicable customizing processes, workflow&#39;s etc has been a breeze. \n\nAlthough the AS package can probably do almost anything with regards to Accounting we recommend spending considerable time planning the implementation as having the optimal page layout&#39;s, the workflow, approval rules, list views, reports, dashboards, e-mail templates, P&amp;L etc. from the beginning will make the start up much easier. \n\nTony and his Team has been great working with. Customer service works well and e-mails have been answered within 1 day consistently. We would recommend Accounting See"

Decisions need to be made by us and our clients that relate to accounting data and the hybrid approach between Quickbooks and a home-grown Salesforce solution wasn&#39;t working.\n\nThese issues have been resolved and a host of other improvements have come about thanks to Accounting Seed and their great insight and support.\n\nHaving the Force.com platform that we know so well behind our accounting provides immeasurable benefit that we now share with our clients.\n\nSome examples:\n\n-- It provides everything for project accounting, deliverables, milestones, time cards, and invoicing right out of the box.\n-- These and other features can be quickly extended to include approval processes, alerts, and analytics using standard configuration.\n-- The data model is clear and understandable with top-notch help documentation/videos.\n-- The extensive use of standard Salesforce reports makes data dreams come true.\n\nThank you Tony, Caroline, John, Chris and the rest of the team and I hope many others seize the opportunity like we did."

In this case, the product is outstanding.  I&#39;ve used and implemented competitors and they all work, to one degree or another.  None of them however, come anywhere close to the flexibility, power, and ease of use that Accounting Seed offers.  It&#39;s pure Salesforce and it shows.\n\nTop that off with some of the best technical client service I&#39;ve ever seen, and you have a winner.  The fact that they&#39;re easy to work with from a partner standpoint is just icing on the cake.\n\nIf you&#39;re the end user, these folk are for you.

Accounting Seed has allowed us to have up to the second accounting data. The expanded visibility of receivables has also enabled the entire organization to facilitate receivables. Since Accounting Seed can be customized, we&#39;ve automated processes that we could only dream of with the limitations of Quickbooks. \n\nI would recommend Accounting Seed to anyone looking to implement an accounting system that will grow with your organization when the sky&#39;s the limit."

When you install the package and look at the object model, it immediately makes sense.\n\nOur business has been running Quickbooks Enterprise for 16 years and its no longer sustainable given our rapid growth. We bandaided the problem for 18 months by setting up an integration with Salesforce, but Quickbooks doesn&#39;t integrate well, with anything.\n\nProcess efficiency is critical for any growing organization and that is why we are thrilled about our accounting migration to Accounting Seed running on Force.com."

									"body": "I\u2019m sorry Aria but I think your comments around managed packages are misleading and fail to take into account generally recognized best practices of how commercial applications are distributed and supported on the force.com platform. \n\nManaged Package is not some \u201cphrase other providers use to explain why we can\u2019t modify org\u201d rather it is the salesforce.com recommended method for distributing and supporting industrial strength applications on the force.com platform ( http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/An_Introduction_to_Packaging ) . Distributing unmanaged packages in the way you describe exposes your business to considerable risk for the following reasons:\n\n- Unmanaged packages are not upgradeable (whereas updates to Managed packages can automatically pushed to your org automatically)\n- Unmanaged packages exposes all the source code and therefore can be edited to break fundamental business rules. \n- Unmanaged packages don\u2019t support namespaces so can cause installation of other packages to fail.\n- Unmanaged packages have no versioning so integrations are easily broken. \n- Unmanaged packages have no licensing control so anyone with a Sys Admin profile will be able to access and potentially modify your Accounting data.\n- Unmanaged packages count against your org limits for tabs and custom objects (Managed packages have no impact on these limits)\n\nDistributing applications via unmanaged packages also represents a significant risk for your provider as all the intellectual property contained in the source code is fully exposed and can be copied, edited and distributed in plain text.\n\nInstalling unmanaged packages takes you down a path to fragile, un-supportable,un-upgradeable systems that will become increasingly costly to keep running. Simply put if your provider is distributing its \u201capp\u201d via unmanaged packages you aren\u2019t getting a product in any true commercial sense rather you are simply getting a loose collection of customizations specific to your org.",

We&#39;ve explored Glovia, Less Software, Ascent -- all in combination with FinancialForce and Quickbooks. We are moving away from the big, bloated Great Plains software and we are ecstatic to be doing so.  \n\n3 Main Reasons:\n1) COMBINED SOLUTION - I can&#39;t stress the importance of this.  The fact that this solution already comes pre-packaged with a WORKING link between the ERP and Accounting Software is a blessing and has saved us lots of time we would otherwise have to spend coordinating Financial Force, and other ERP packages....and if you&#39;re not planning to use FF, good luck tying any of the other packages with QB.  In the years I&#39;ve been using Quickbooks, I&#39;ve come to learn its never going to be perfect and there are always glitches when trying to sync using some kind of middleware or &quot;web-services&quot; type solutions....\n\n2)  COST - You can&#39;t beat the value.  You really can&#39;t.  Less Software i think was a 7 license minimum and FF had a $750 month requirement plus HUGE implementation costs...really!?  FF wouldn&#39;t even talk to our subsidiary because they were &quot;too small&quot; at the time.  I think any sales manager with half a brain should consider that getting in early during the growth phase of a small business is the right time to do so in order to prevent huge costs associated with data migrations to new system later on.  It was a blessing in disguise -- AS set us up with ERP and cccounting packages for prices you can&#39;t find with ANY other software.  I&#39;m not just talking about the cloud or Force.com platform, here.  \n\n3) OPEN - Cannot stress this enough.  The fact that AS is not a dreaded &quot;Managed Package&quot; (phrase other providers use to explain why we can&#39;t modify org) is a big deal.  Ascent, FF, Less ... all closed packages. Good luck tweaking. Tweaking AS to our company&#39;s flavor has been easy.  Email me at"

Five years later we are still using this very excellent app. AccountingSeed works very well for our business and the support and native integration to SalesForce is great.\n\nAccountingSeed has been a great partner for us. We started with basic SalesForce CRM tools, and then wanted to expand this functionality by adding Accounting tools. The developers at Accounting Seed helped us to configure their application, coached us through use of the app, helped us determine the design we wanted, listened to our feedback and implemented our requirements.\n\nI recommend this application and the team of developers behind it. They have worked with us and now the accounting application is exactly what we need. All requested customization has been delivered and works well for our business."

Our customers have found great success with the solution, and having just deployed it internally a couple of months ago, we are too.  The interface is seamless since it was built on the platform.  Managing/tracking our projects, viewing billing and payment status, expenses tracking, etc. is all so simple as it lives directly in the core Salesforce objects in which we operate.  Having been involved in dozens of projects that involve a custom integration between Salesforce and a non-platform accounting system, I can say that this is a VERY clean solution as it truly does appear to be part of the core Salesforce solution.  It doesn&#39;t require a 3rd party tool (major cost savings) or complex data mapping, but does allow for customizations to accommodate each specific customer&#39;s needs.  We made a number of customizations and it works great for our business.  Very powerful and very clean.  I&#39;d highly recommend this solution to any Salesforce customer considering a new financial management solution."

Your global team no longer has to VPN to their accounting package.\n\nIt&#39;s also great at managing inventory instead of trying to tackle it with QuickBooks."

My company implements marketing automation solutions by Implementing an AppExchange solution from ActOn Software.  We partnered together on an implementation for the &quot;Private Jet Charter&quot; industry.  It became clear that before we could be effective with marketing automation, we had to get the accounting functionality mapped out, so our client could manage cash flow and create a strong financial foundation.  Our client got the best of both worlds, and the most for their time and money.  It&#39;s a fantastic one-two punch, now they can process orders, payments and put their finger on the pulse of the business from and accounting and marketing perspective.  The intrinsic value of their business is now measurable, accountable, and flexible, allowing them to an unfair advantage in their industry.  The processes that have been implemented has completely changed the game, multiple workflows, alerts that now happen are allowing the team to focus on servicing the customer, instead of drowning in the process.  They now have a very scale-able business model, which is also allowing them to attract better talent.  Yes, this client is &quot;taking  off&quot;, (I had to do it, that softball was just hanging out there;)\nCheers, Chris Kiersch"

With my staff being so familiar with salesforce to begin with, there has been very little time wasted on excessive training on an accounting platform. Being able to merge sales data and analytics with accounting is a &quot;logical&quot; feature but so hard to come by even with all the modern technology that is available today. Our company from day 1 wanted a platform that would eliminate double data entry and servers. The combination of using salsforce (an amazing cloud CMS) combined with the simple user friendly interface and accounting functions from Accounting Seed has saved our company thousands of dollars in time, and allowed us to focus our time on more important things like business development, sales and recruiting. Having all of your companies vital information in one spot, accessible from anywhere is WELL worth the investment."

Let me start by saying that we orignally had another CRM integrator that we were working with to help us come up with a complete online business system that could be integrated with Salesforce....what a mess that was!  That team was great at creating lists that never got done and ate up a few dollars with no results.  \n\nWhen we met Tony and Caroline with Accounting Seed, that all changed...they led us down the RIGHT path.  With their expert knowledge and ease of navigating in not only their Accounting Seed system, but also in Salesforce, they make things happen!  Their ability to listen and understand our business process needs and then develop as well as implement them in this system was remarkable."

In that time, we have constantly searched for an effective and AFFORDABLE Cloud Accounting alternative that we could offer to our customers without hesitation.  Accounting Seed has proven to be that alternative.\n\nOur experience has been so good that we have moved our own accounting structure from QuickBooks to Accounting Seed.  It is a HUGE undertaking for any company, but the guidance provided by Tony and Caroline has been spectacular.  They have addressed, with great patience, the unique elements of our processes and demonstrated how easy it is to customize the application to our needs, in keeping with the fundamental benefits of the SFDC platform.  In particular, our deployment of Accounting Seed is producing process efficiencies that are saving significant time and effort vs. our old system as it relates to activities like billing, expense reimbursement, month-end close, and the management visibility and analytics required to run our business. \n\nWe look forward to introducing Accounting Seed to our current and future customers as a viable method to help create a &quot;single source of truth&quot; enterprise-wide, in one cloud environment."

Accounting Seed has succeeded by not just rewriting a traditional accounting solution on the Platform but using the unique capabilities of the Platform to build integrated and elegant processes across the front and back office.  Accounting Seed has benefited from being both experts on the Platform and legacy accounting products.  Yes, other providers have tried to do this.  However, they have forced the Platform to confirm to what they thought accounting systems should be like in the 90s.  Accounting Seed is using in the flexibility of the Platform to create clean and simple integration between front and back office processess.  Salesforce has built a pretty good company creating and leveraging this flexibility in their core products and I think Accounting Seed is following this successful approach.  In my opinion, they have created the best balance between how the Finance Team needs to work and the flexibility required to make the front office successful.  In 10 years we are going to look back and question why you would deploy a Platform solution without a full accounting module."

Our recent decision to be engaged with Accounting Seed stems from the fact that we were impressed with the breadth of the functionality their solutions offer, SaaS solution, and native to Salesforce.com.  The benefits are a faster implementation realizing quicker ROI, but more importantly a reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) since there is no need to develop integration touch-points that must be continuously updated with any new release."

From billing to payment, logging to reporting, hooking custom work into the solution is easy not just because the design makes sense, but also because they expose functionality that assists developers in making those connections correctly.  Above all that... the AccountingSeed team is helpful and extremely responsive which makes working with their solution a pleasure.

It meets our client&#39;s needs perfectly, and our needs as Salesforce.com partners by giving  us a means to give our clients the solutions that they need.  Further, their support is fantastic. Instead of creating cases that get moved through queues requiring days to find the right person to help us, they immediately get on the phone, find the answer that we need, and keep us moving forward.

We have implemented \"Communities\" for our overseas workers to see their financial results in real time (money in and money out). We also implemented the Partner Community for our financial donors to be able to make new commitments, update bank/credit card information and see payment histories. We have lots of further projects in both these areas to expand capabilities, interconnections and communications. \n\nWe have also undertaken a rewrite of our corporate website to utilize SalesForce Sites and enable new financial partners to make commitments and donations online. Each new gift is immediately turned into an AccountingSeed cash receipt. Likewise new commitments on the website are immediately reflected in the employee community and accessible globally.\n\nWe have also implemented a Retiree object to track information and payment histories with regard to an old defined benefit pension plan.\n\nAnother system we are evaluating is our \"Keeping Fit\" heath and well being program that provides reimbursements and incentives for employees to exercise and \"keep fit\". Like many benefit programs, there are guidelines, criteria and limits that need to be tracked and adhered to for eligibility. \n\nThere is a lot of opportunity for continued creativity and connectivity of our constituents. SalesForce and AccountingSeed in the same \"ecosystem\" make that possible in a seamless manner.  \n\nYes, it has been a lot of work, but we have, in fact, rebuilt the organizations information systems and financial systems without any interruption of service to our constituents. Now, I am not Pollyanna, this was hard work, there were processes to be cleaned up, regulations that had to be incorporated and an occasional delay in processing while we sorted ourselves out. This was the right thing to do and the right time to do it. No turning back!",

									"body": "1) There are a lot of companies making similar transitions. WorldVenture is a SalesForce and an AccountingSeed reference account. \n2) My primary counsel to people who inquire is that the Software changes are the easiest part of the conversion. When you have been around as long as we have (75 years) and you have had established processes that have not changed in decades (for us, 40 years) - then the HARD PART is the necessary \"re-think\" of the business process analysis. We formed teams to reevaluate everything we were doing and to define (and in some cases retain) the process so it was relevant to the way we operate today. This brings the organization together and it \"cleans up\" the process and the historical \"work rounds\" that may have existed. The downside is that this step takes time, must have leadership buyin and ultimately results in workflow and cultural changes within the organization.\n3. Dissect your business processes and \"migrate\" subsystems to AccountingSeed in stages. We are a $30M/year operation and we have to \"fly the plane while rebuilding it\". That means, no weekend conversion. As a result, we phased our implementation in sections by subsystems. First we moved our cash receipting processes (Money in), then while we fine tuned that, we began migration of our payroll subsystems. Over the years, we had 4 variations of payroll operations for domestic and international employees. We took almost a year to \"harmonize\" all of those functions, processes, conditions to one standard payroll and we used a non-SalesForce cloud solution for that. At the end of payroll, we then import more 5000 journal entries into AccountingSeed. After payroll, we moved on to Cash Disbursements and Accounts Payable (Money out).\n4. Once all the funds were flowing through AccountingSeed, we then focused on the reporting. When that was done, we made AccountingSeed our System of record and severed the \"backfeed\" connection to our legacy system.",

Tony and his team &quot;totally get it&quot; when it comes to non-profit Fund Accounting. Those large &quot;Finance Cloud&quot; companies did not and would not spend the time trying to understand us nor adapt their offering\n\nWorldVenture is implementing SalesForce from &quot;Wall to Wall&quot; with everything from Facilities Management to Human Resources to Accounting. That means our Partner, Accounting Seed, needed to work with other firms in order to take their Asset Management Depreciation Schedules and turn them in to an Accounting Seed Journal Entry for each period. Tony and his team were totally on board that integration is more than silo applications - it is the entire business process eco-system.\n\nThe best part of peeling away decades of process and implementation practices, is that Tony and his team have led us through the FAFSA principles of accounting and enabled us to re-engineer our business processes so that we are not just using cloud software, but that we are optimizing our process and doing it in accord with current accounting standards.\n\nAt WorldVenture, we are so excited with our SalesForce implementation beause we have chosen firms, like Accounting Seed, that care about our success, that actually enjoy interacting with their clients and that learn new ways to adapt and expand their product offering based on how their customers actually use it. Those are the firms that we are selecting. Those are the firms that will ultimately be here long after the &quot;big boys&quot; have blown the advertising budget pushing cookie cutter one size fits all implementations with huge price tags.

I can not say enough good things about how they have set up our system and the amount of time and care they have put into our needs. Accounting Seed is going to save us hundreds of ours every year. This is a good company to be a partner with and we plan to work with them for years to come."

									"response": "We switched our company over to Salesforce from MS Access and Quickbooks just recently. While Salesforce is a great CRM it sorely lacks in project management and accounting ability (i.e. it has none), that&#39;s where Accounting Seed came in. We looked at numerous other programs for both project management and accounting to tie into Salesforce, but many lacked the features and flexibility that Accounting Seeds provides. The program is also a great value. When comparing the ROI of Accounting Seed against many of the other programs out there, it was a no brainer. It really is what you need to manage your CRM from lead to final billing. \n\nWe also use the app to manage our projects. As a roofing/construction company, each project we do is unique. Accounting Seed has been a great tool for allowing us to see how well we did on each project. We love the ability to be able to quickly analyze a project and quickly spot areas of concern. They were also able to tie our employees time and cost to each individual project, which has saved NUMEROUS hours of having to hand calculate who worked on what project and when. \n\nI find the reporting to be quite useful and mostly intuitive as well. The main thing holding back a 5 star rating is the app inability to calculate overtime pay(hopefully coming in a later release). During our busy season, we constantly have crews in OT weekly. The company could also communicate a bit better when updates are released to the app. \n\nOverall, I will say they have done a stellar job concerning support, implementation, and customization for our particular needs. I feel if they can accommodate a setup and customization as complex as ours, they can help any Salesforce customer finally tie it together from lead to final bill. I would not hesitate to recommend Accounting Seeds to anybody!"

I know no app is perfect and there are areas of improvement (reporting?).

I was very skeptical because I had used Quickbooks for so long, but our company needed to switch to Salesforce for other reasons therefore I had to switch my accounting software as well.  I have been using it for a couple of months and I must say it is very user friendly.  What I like most about the program is that it is VERY customizable and the support has been great.  We set up &quot;go to meetings&quot; with the people at Accounting Seed which allows me to learn hands on and ask any questions as I go along.  The whole package is not cheap, BUT, we feel the benefits will definitely outweight the costs in the long run.  We did a lot of research looking for a software package to meet all our needs and we are confident we have found one.  So for all you Quickbook users out there who are reluctant to &quot;take the plunge&quot;, just do it!  \nJean Kovach-Office Manager/Runyon &amp; Sons Roofing, Inc."

We were previously on Microsoft Dyanamics GP and were trying to synch Salesforce to accounting via a connector tool that I will not mention in this review since I do not have anything positive to say about it.  Accounting Seed was the solution. This app is well designed and fits right in with salesforce very well. \n\nThe app is not perfect. There is definitely room to improve, but I felt that the Accounting Seed team cared about our problems and stayed true to their claim of prioritizing the road map based on existing customer requests. I have a lot of respect for the team there. They certainly know what they are doing. I do recommend the app for anyone looking to be in a single environment in the cloud."

I have nothing but good things to say about their product and company.\n\nFirst of all, the application itself is designed to be very flexible so that you can easily integrate your CRM and other processes directly to your accounting processes. As a systems integrator, I appreciate how easy they make it. The end result is seamless, end-to-end business processes without the typical integration hassles and headaches.\n\nSecond, the product has a robust feature set. I particularly like the user-defined financial reporting engine. While we all love the analytics that Salesforce provides, financial reports are complex and require specialized formatting. Accounting Cloud takes care of this for you.\n\nAnd last but not least, the team there is fantastic. Their support staff is second to none. They also have TRUE expertise in this space and have a long history working with accounting/ERP packages. When implementing something as important as your financials, experience like you find at Accounting Seed is a must-have."

One of the coolest things here is that I feel like I even understand accounting better than I ever did before since I have used the salesforce UI for several years and I already know it. I am not as scared of the accounting objects since I know the user interface already. \n\nThis is a HUGE step forward for ERP and salesforce!!! Nice Job, Accounting Seed!"
