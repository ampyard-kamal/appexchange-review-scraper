I will probably be back sometime again with questions or to implement one of the other features but until then. \n\nI recommend this if you are looking to integrate QuickBooks with Salesforce, the DBSync studio is pretty clean and user friendly too.\n\nThanks!"

Once we were put in touch with a DB Sync developer via Go To Meeting (GTM), the programmer was able to resolve our issues and help us with some other software issues that had been causing inconvenience for several years. At the end of the call, we test-synced two sales orders and we are hopeful that things will now work smoothly, as we need them to.\n\nWe are unhappy with the amount of time it took them to get back with us, but we are very happy with the attention to detail that the programmer provided, and with the results of the call."

Sometimes it can be a little difficult to get around, but if you are having trouble in navigating, their support team is fantastic so just ask them for help.  I also wish I had more capability to debug or preview results, which I cannot do against my Quickbooks environment while working in the DBsync web interface.  Also, the user interface within Salesforce does not work where I would expect it to.  The user interface in Salesforce may just be due to a lack of an update in our system, but I would like to be able to manage at least a little more of DB Sync from within Salesforce."

However, the free Version was not enough to suffice your requirements and Our Rep clearly mentioned that we do not provide any support for the free version. We follow this practice so that we can keep our customers informed beforehand as to what our Product is capable of. As per your requirement you have to have our Enterprise version.Hence our Sales rep wanted to let know about the other versions we have.\n\nWe value all of our clients regardless of what Version of DBSync they are using. If you are still interested, please contact our sales team and they will be able to assist you\nAlso i request you to re-consider your review as we pride ourselves to have a perfect 5/5 rating. Please feel free to reachout to us if you have any questions\n\nThanks \nDavid\nDBSync",

I&#39;m disappointed with the way the installation call become a sales pitch, and it&#39;s taken the whole afternoon to get to this point.  All could have been avoided if they were upfront with the pricing from the start."

They are so professional, prompt, the Bi-directional link was up and running when they said. The product is great, the support staff and customer service is fantastic. DB SYNC works like a dream even though we had a lot of custom objects the team at DB SYNC just made it work. I really wish they had programmed all of Salesforce for me. Even after we had been up and running for about a month I need to have more mapping completed and they were right on it. Within 2 days everything was completed.

Our experience has been one where they are very responsive, polite and very helpful.  Sharath specifically has done a great job explaining the &quot;why&quot; certain things will or wont work as well how to implement new processes.  Thanks guys!"

However, over the last six months, there has nearly been weekly calls and attempts to fix problems that should not be occurring, such as duplicating products in SF, duplicating invoices, etc. The support team are friendly, but the countless hours spent fixing problems has increased costs and unfortunately lost the confidence of our team and CEO. On-top of it all, there was a price increase this year, which we did not argue and unfortunately, instead of seeing fewer problems, we&#39;ve paid more money and increased the number of problems...\n\nCurrently, we are looking into other sync options. We pay for something and expect it to work properly and unfortunately the sync has caused many more problems for accounting, sales, and the IT department."

Not contacts/customers, nor Sales Receipts, or anything else. And NO data migration - you do it all from scratch. I learned a lot, but I wished I learned what I needed to know fast enough to not waste so much my time!\n\nThe Uninstall seemed to work very easily, and quickly! :)"

Since the acquisition of our company earlier this year, the volume of transactions we process has increased hugely. We have had to make DBSync mandatory and look at how we can make efficiency improvements across our entire ordering process. We are delighted with support available from the team at Avankia, but in particular, I must call out Ullas Narasimha Moorthy, who has worked tirelessly with us to understand our needs and make the required customisations for us. Some of the problems we&#39;ve encountered were caused by us, and not the responsibility of Ullas. However, he has gone the extra mile and helped us understand where we were going wrong\u2014above and beyond the call of duty\u2014even on his day off. We are delighted with the support. Thank you Ullas and the rest of the team.\nNow... to explore the potential of the JIRA link you also offer..."

We also collect employee expenses in FF and send those to QB for payment.  The interface has been reliable and efficient.  When we have had questions or a record problem (usually a condition or data element we did not test for), DBSync has been responsive in resolving the issue quickly and getting us current on our integration.\n\nThe only time we have seen a data discrepancy, has been when a record was in transit from FF to QB and the connection was dropped - so the record appeared in QB, but the record in FF was not updated to indicate it had been sent.  The result was a duplicate Expense Report in QB.  We have put procedures in place to monitor for this should it ever happen.  This is really not a DBSync issue, but rather a circumstance that cannot really be accounted for by the software.\n\nI would recommend this product for the type of integrations we are doing."

This presented challenges in getting things done efficiently and timely.\n- I thought the process of explaining what we wanted done could have gone a bit faster, but at the same time I am very pleased with the due diligence and level of expertise that they brought. Sometimes I felt like there was a bit more put on us to do than I would have liked, in terms of filling out a technical excel document.\n- I was very satisfied with the amount of time they invested in helping us understand the process and answering any questions we had.\nOnce everything was implemented, ran into a few issues, but loved that Ankur didn&#39;t wait for what he requested from us and did it on his own. Got the ball rolling. Much appreciated."

We had some specific needs and unique fields and they were able to find a way to sync them.\n\nMain areas of syncing-\nOpportunities from SF to QB as invoices\nProducts from QB to SF, every 20 minutes, for an up to date inventory view for our road reps\n\nThey were also able to migrate past opportunities (invoices) from QB to SF so we are able to fully utilize Saleforce&#39;s reports for all of our departmental reporting.  \n\nVery prompt in responding and had a wonderful and professional attitude.  Really liked working with them!  Thank you for all of your help!"

We follow this practice so that we can keep our customers informed before hand as to what our Product is capable of.\nAlso as per your statement above you wanted data migration on the 1st call itself with the free version of our tool. Our Free version only supports syncing invoice unidirectional from Salesforce to QuickBooks. As per your requirement you have to have our Cloud Workflow Enterprise version (https://www.mydbsync.com/product/salesforce-crm-adapter). \nWhen we discussed this on call you were repeatedly asking to do it for free which is not possible in our free version of our tool. If you are still interested please contact our sales rep and they will be able to assist you.",

There are times when I have tried working with a less experienced individual only to give up and ask for Kishore&#39;s help. And sure enough we are able to solve the problem after Kishore gets involved. He is a good listener, processes the issue and is proactive about trying a myriad of ways to attack the issue. He has got a great attitude. Overall a solid employee. Many thanks for the help!"

By determining an appropriate order of run of processes, Customers, Invoices, Payments and Credits can be moved to Quickbooks.\nAt times, the scheduled jobs disappear from the front end forcing us to reschedule only for us to find out that they were actually running in the background. Also movement of multiple child object records from a parent record in Salesforce (using a subquery ) seems to be a bit difficult.\n\nIn case of multiple similar connections to be established, download and upload of existing processes is possible which actually saves a lot of time.\n\nCareful mapping and ordering of processes can lead to a  smooth integration to a certain extent but with close monitoring.\n\nThe support is also good without any major delays in response."

									"response": "DB Sych was not first choice, I went to another company. I thought there pricing was ok and customer support had good reviews. Well after not even a week, I realized this company was not the right move. I have chosen incorrectly. Cancelled immediately, we are going in another direction. I contacted DB Synch immediately and we got cooking. So let\u2019s dig into the details, some folks in USA are concerned about DBsych tech support being in India and not USA. This is an issue for some, I work with folks over skype all the time that are in India and they do great, no I didn\u2019t want to work with someone I couldn\u2019t understand on the phone, BUT the few people I spoke with at DB synch spoke very good English. Don\u2019t be fooled, this is a very complex set up blending Salesforce and QB. There is a lot of stuff going on. Since I didn\u2019t really have my accounts in salesforce yet, I wasn\u2019t concerned with a data issue; most synch companies have boiler plate set up with only so much information migrating over, before you have to pay more to get more. It is what is, but for the most part, I got what I wanted, all customer information, phone, fax, 2 contacts, 2 emails even my notes from QB. Now that is only synching one way, but they can do some custom stuff to have some synch back the other way. All this is custom work. Even with all that you have to realize not everything can be done. I have been running for a week so far, no down time, no errors, and no mistakes. So far so good. I want to do some extra work and have them bring over all my data, invoices and payments. This will cost another pretty penny but it is well worth it.The tech I worked with was Apoorva K.B / Product Engineer this guy really knew his stuff. He was able to get on the phone with me and on my computer at the same time; we worked for about three hours one day. Make sure you know what you want? And talk with them, you will be suprised what you can sych, even both ways. But you will have to pay a little more for extra"

									"body": "Jeremy,\n\nI do remember meeting you over a drink 3-4 years back at Dreamforce. You had challenges with your then Salesforce & QuickBooks provider as they could not get your environment to work. I do certainly want to thank you for given us the opportunity to assist you and see your firm grow. I was running some numbers and did see that DBSync processed 787,410 rows of records for you in the last 12 months, which puts your instance in the top 5% of our Salesforce & QuickBooks user usage.\nWe do see that often Business users do not understand QuickBooks enough and run into issues when configuring which is why whenever we see this happening we recommend that our support team assist. You can certainly do your mapping as many of our customers successfully do everyday. \n\nOur initial version was very simple (similar to most of our competitors now), we quickly realized that most QB users do not have straight forward and we re-did the platform so that we can support them. When you try address all sorts of use cases, the application tends to become \"technical\", we try to make it business user friendly, but at times its more technical than what business users can handle. We did it to make sure we can address the growing number of use cases like PO integration, timesheet integration, Partial invoicing, multiple QB file support etc. \n\nWe must be doing something right that we are still going strong when 3 of our competitors including Intuit could not support such an offering and shutdown. Further we are the only ones on Gartner MQ for iPaaS which still has an Enterprise lever offering for QuickBooks user community at a very competitive pricing.\nI do understand some of your frustrations and would like to address those\n\n1. We have documentation in our Wiki site and is heavily used. We also have best practices. At times it does get technical as it does support more than just QuickBooks but also databases, XML etc.\n\nContinued on next comment...",

User Interface was re-written and has been rolled out last year, we have had many compliments and have made it easier for our customers to do quite a bit themselves, including some very complex setups. I believe this was rolled out to you Q3/Q4 of last year.\n\n3. I was told there was a Scheduler issue that impacted your node (and also other customers) and our team deligently worked through to fix it and we have not had such an outage since then even when Amazon Web Services was hit and brought down many services.\n\n4. The package you likely have is an old version which is why you might have seen some links not working. That tab was for support and now we have a Wiki and community site. Our package is very slim on customization and mostly has fields. DBSync does most of the heavy lifting.\n\nI would like to thank you for recognizing our support team. We did our best to make sure things were working for you and never charged for support when there was data issues. We have many customers who leave us come back to us \u2013 perhaps that the realize that support is equally important as the product when you are running your Accounting / business on it. \n\nThanks\nRajeev Gupta\nFounder / CEO, DBSync",

									"response": "We were a customer for the last three years and have now decided to move on from the product.  If you are looking for a simple and I mean very simple QuickBooks to Salesforce integration, then this might work for you.  If you need anything that isn&#39;t basic, then you will have to pay the company to create the integration for you.  The product coins itself as an integration platform, but it is hardly that.  The ability for YOU the user to build a custom integration with Quickbooks is almost impossible and here&#39;s why:\n\n1. Documentation is almost none existent or very outdated.  If you are the type of person that is a DIY type and you rely on good or at least decent documentation, I am sorry you are out of luck here.\n\n2. User Interface - The user interface is terrible, even after they upgraded it this past year, things do not make sense and aren&#39;t logical.  Nothing is intuitive or even remotely logical.  It is almost like they spent 95% of the budget on the code and 5% on the UI design.\n\n3. Bugs -  Over the years we dealt with lots of bugs, duplicate invoices being created in QuickBooks, the system just crashing and not working, connections just going offline, ect.  It was so frustrating that I emailed the CEO once on LinkedIn to get some help, he responded and helped get the issue resolved.  We spent hours trying to find workarounds.\n\n4. Sloppy - Overall the app is just sloppy from tabs not working in the managed package to links not working in the &quot;new&quot; version of the app.\n\nThe reason I gave the review two stars instead of one is because of the support which is the one bright spot. They do have great support and will work to make you happy or fix the issue.  However, this is not how things are supposed to work in 2017, great support to make up for a poorly designed product."

It is a fantastic timesaver.\n\nREVIEW UPDATE 1:\nAfter a long development period (August - January), the integration is finally working. Avankia credited us 3 months for the delay we experienced, which was much appreciated. Although our experience with development was lamentable, the integration is now working smoothly.\n\nHad development been completed quickly and effectively, I would rate this product 5 stars. As it has only been working for 2 weeks, I will update this review again in several weeks once we have more experience with the product.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: \nWe have been trying to get this up and running since late August, it is now mid-December. Support has been responsive with correspondence, but we have been very disappointed with how extraordinarily long it has taken to get the integration up and running (it still is not working). We are still excited about the prospect of the solution working: the high ratings of other customers is reassuring.\n\nIf you are considering purchasing, I would advise the following: create a complete overview of how you want the integration to function, send it to the provider and have them sign off on it BEFORE you purchase. We had the plan for the integration but felt that it was not reviewed by the developer. This resulted in a number of extra, unexpected costs (which were never indicated by the salesperson). \n\nEven once development had started, we had several calls to address the same issue and encountered entirely foreseeable issues that have delayed launch. \n\nGiven this experience I would also advise that the timelines given by the developer are unreliable. In our experience, we have paid for several months of license where the product is unusable. \n\nI will certainly update this review once the product begins to function."

I&#39;ll update my review in another few weeks once we&#39;ve had an opportunity to thoroughly review the product.\n\nInitial Review:\nWe were very excited about the prospect of having a true bi-directional sync setup and are still hopeful. Here are some things you should know before buying:\n\n1. Get a complete cost quote for all of your requirements: When we started, we thought we would just be paying for the basic package (we needed orders to sync to sales orders). This ended up not being the case. As soon as you are outside of their default package, you will pay another several hundred dollars per year. We accepted those costs. Then when we went to implement, there were additional costs given to us for development. These were never discussed with the salesperson when we were evaluating. We felt this was underhanded.\n\n2. Do not expect the integration to be up and running quickly: Development was supposed to have taken a couple of weeks. We began in August and provided full documentation on how we wanted the sync to work (and still had several questions RE capabilities, constraints, etc.). Several phone calls, webinars later, we were no further. It is now Mid-December and we still do not have a functional integration. We brought this to their attention several weeks ago and they said that they would fast-track the project to be done in a week or two. It has been nearly 2 months.\n\nI can not provide a good review of the software because at this time it simply does not work. I will update this review whenever it is actually up and running."

Pratik - your Account Manager has already sent you copies of SOW and invoices clarifying it. The system turns off if subscription expires automatically (as with any other subscription based service). Pratik has also reached out to you through phone and email to see if how he can assist you. \n\nSecondly, we do acknowledge that some of our customers did have scheduler related issues in one of our node and your instance was known to be affected. We identified this about four days back and our engineering team worked diligently to resolve it. As of last night we did verify that all customers impacted with this scheduler issue were stable. For issues that you might have faced beyond the last week, the likely cause is something other than the platform. I would like to get our professional services team relook at it and resolve it.\n\nWe certainly value you as our customer and would like to get an opportunity to discuss how best we can resolve this issue. \n\nThanks\nRajeev Gupta",

We switched to QuickBooks Online in January of this year, we told them we wanted it set up the exact same way as our desktop sync.  Not only was it not, but it took literally FIVE months to get it working.  They made us buy a new license in January for the Online version, took 5 months to get it working, this month it&#39;s been down again, and they just turned us off today saying our license is expiring today.  The language barrier is a huge role in my frustration as well.  I cannot find another service to use instead of DBSync fast enough."

He overcame a number of technical hurdles both on our end at at DBSync that were making the solution of our problem harder than usual.  We are very grateful for the time and effort expended on our behalf, and is especially remarkable since we have the free version of the connector."

The product is much easier to use and syncs wonderfully, unless we have made a mistake on our end.  But even then, DBSync has made it very easy for us to find the problem and fix it in order to sync again.  The staff are quite helpful, especially Jithesh Vasudevan, who we work with almost exclusively.  If I run into a question or problem, he follows up and calls to fix it.  Most of the time, the problems are self-induced, but he&#39;s great help me figure out what I did wrong.  I highly recommend DBSync."

Throughout the implementation and post implementation phase both were extremely responsive and instrumental and were easy to work with. They did a great job with customization, mappings and integration work.. With their coordination, we were able to customize our QB integration exactly how we wanted!.

The system is completely proprietary and requires DBSync&#39;s assistance to make any changes.\n- Mapping fields to QuickBooks is limited and can be a bit frustrating (NOTE: This is not DBSync&#39;s fault. This is a QuickBooks limitation)"

Whenever I have a tech support question, they have responded and worked with me to find a solution, especially Jasvinder and Sujay. One thing I will say is that if you are going to get this App, ask a lot of questions up front. Be clear with them on what your needs are and find out exactly what the costs are in advance. At the beginning, the DBSync team gave me the chance to make sure that the sync&#39;d fields were mapped to the proper destination and there was a small dispute regarding the cost of bringing in historical data from Sales Order records. In the end, the DBSync team made it right and provided superior customer service."

This app does everything we expect it to and more.  We were very limited with the Quickbooks built-in sync and could only sync basic sales order information.  With DBsync we have been able to sync sales orders as well receivables which helps our different departments keep track of records across the board."

We are a very small company (6 employees), so we don&#39;t have large budgets to be able to implement and customize our Salesforce org. During my first year, I used their basic services and everything went perfect! On my second year, I wanted to leverage more of this product&#39;s power, so I asked DBsync for some customization. The price was high for what I was hoping to pay, however, I must agree that Apoorva and Susmith really put in a lot of hours to test, configure, troubleshoot, and make sure that everything was working to my standards. I even changed my mind on a few things along the way, and they went the extra mile and even took care of those changes for me without trying to nickel and dime me for additional changes. They went above and beyond my expectations, and most importantly, stuck the original agreed upon budget for this project.\n\nI plan to be doing additional changes in the coming year (when I have a little more money set aside for this), and can&#39;t begin to explain how much time this product has saved me. Most importantly, this will now save me a ton of CASH by not needing my bookkeeper to do most of this work anymore.\n\nThank you Apoorva, Susmith, &amp; the entire DBsync Team!"

To eliminate manually transferring our Invoices and Purchase Orders from Salesforce to Quickbooks we naturally started looking for a solution. We landed on Dbysnc to assist us. We were originally attempting the Bi-Directional sync, but that ended up not being the option for us at this time. Mid project we switched to one directional. We are still very happy with the product. There was some configuration and mapping changes needing to be made, due to our needs, and Dbysnc was very helpful. After implementation we requested a lot of customization as we learned what would work best for us. Dbysnc stepped up and was extremely helpful with all our needs and ideas. They are all very knowledgeable of both products. Their service is what I am most pleased with. Vinay in particular has been outstanding with his response, patience, helpfulness and willingness to assist us with all our requests. The great thing with this team is they will not stop until you are 100% satisfied with their product and I can say we are very satisfied with both the product and especially service. We look forward to continuing to use Dbysnc as a long term partner."

We need to sync some custom fields and worked with Pratik Sanikop in Sales to make sure all our requirements were met. He laid out the timeline and beat the estimated launch date target.\n\nSo far, the implementation it has met our expectations and needs. There have been a few small issues to resolve post-implementation, which is to be expected, but Ankur Ghosh has been very quick to reply to our emails and has solved our problems within a matter of minutes in some cases. Our initial impression is that choosing dbSync as a vendor to help us with our syncing needs was a great choice and we look forward to continue working with them moving forward."

You can always have our team review the configuration or ask your implementation Partner to do so. Further we do not have details on what your needs are.\n\nChecking with my team, it seems like you where creating custom fields on QB Online reports that you wanted to pull through QB API. QuickBooks online / Intuit does not provide papbiliites yet for us to pull that data and so we cannot support it. Perhaps, you should raise this complain / review with QuickBooks Online/ Intuit to get it resolved.\n\nYour experience with your implementation partner should not be the cause of raising a negative review here for DBSync to get your refund. We stand by our product and its capabilities.\n\nI am the Founder & CEO for DBSync and you can reachout to me directly if you have any questions or assistance regarding our product.\n\nThanks\nRajeev Gupta",

I also appreciated how he responded very quickly, provided frequent updates, and gave thorough explanations and tips.  In doing so, he made sure that the sync worked 100% right. \n\nBest regards, \n\nMarketing Manager from Eurotrol, Inc."

Susmith customized the integration for me on the spot.  I was so worried when Intuit stopped supporting the SF to QB link but this experience was a lot less painful than I expected working with DBSync.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the need to have an additional login of QB opened to complete the sync. This is only an issue if you host your company file somewhere besides your desktop."

									"response": "We are a midsize software company that just switched to DBS after Intuit dropped support for their SF-QB product on December 3, 2014. We were looking for an alternative that, at a minimum, mimicked the Intuit application. We needed something that would create a new account in SF when an invoice was generated by QB.  In addition we needed to move to SF from QB all relevant info needed by sales and support to service the account.  I was very skeptical of the solution at first having been burned badly by another company on the AppExchange a couple of years ago.  I am pleased to report that the DBsync solution really works and the support team, albeit offshore, is excellent and easy to understand. My support person was Jasvinder.  He pushed extremely hard to make sure I was satisfied with the end result and he did not try to nickel and dime me.  So far I am quite pleased and it a process that I can understand.  I highly recommend the app and Jasvinder in particular to get it installed."

This was largely due to the excellent support from the dbsync team (I worked directly with David, Vinod, Rinesh, and Jasvinder).  The sync is working great and my client is very happy with the customization we were able achieve with dbsync.\n\nI will be recommending dbsync to all of my current and future clients that are wanting to sync their Salesforce Org and QuickBooks.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me directly with any questions you might have about my experience in working with Avankia to set up the sync between Salesforce and QuickBooks.  My email is josh@squareblueconsulting.com and my phone number is (470)-237-2702.\n\nCongrats Avankia on a great product and very helpful support team!\n\n-josh"

Their pre-sales team gets you set up and connected right away so you can experiment. Purchasing the software was fast and easy. Setup and preparation to the changeover was responsive and helpful. And post switchover - Yesterday morning - the DB SYnc team quickly got my sales team off my back and opportunities synching - and product shipping. Susmith is wise and caring, making me feel special, but most importantly, solves any issues quickly. Can&#39;t wait to see how far we can customize this to our quirks. If these guys can&#39;t do it, it can&#39;t be done. Go get it now."

Again we have a trial period so that you have a choice of not buying if you dont like it.\n\nAlso in website it clearly says Customizations are additional charges. Please again see http://www.mydbsync.com/free_sf_qb under Professional Services section. \n\nNo where it says we will do all customizations for free - we will go out of business as others did - see again this listing from Intuit stating they could not handle the customizations as one of the reasons to stop the offering. \n\nRead this - https://salesforceforquickbooks.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203141840-About-Discontinuation-FAQ\n\nAlso, I have never raised this with other negative reviews before, but in this case I have to speak out. Professionally you should not be abusive. Being abusive will not get you free stuff. I was told that you where very abusive to our support team. You had a budget of $700 and wanted everything else for free. We are humans too. Treat others as you would like to be treated.\n\nYou have a choice to buy or not during this trial period.

All of our invoices and payments move seamlessly from SF into QB. Subhani has been great to work with on getting this setup and running, however the implementation process before we started to deal with him was a little shaky. \n\nWhat was initially scoped out to be a few months to implement ended up being a year long project requiring a lot of custom code from us which was not initially scoped. This was no doubt because of the complex nature of our SF environment which was not thoroughly scoped out when the project was quoted. Nevertheless both sides were flexible in terms of cost &amp; hours and in the end we got this project over the hump with help from Vinay &amp; Subhani. \n\n5 stars for the product and support, 4 stars for the implementation &amp; quoting."

Of course there were a few bumps in the road, but that&#39;s expected with any type of custom integration. However, when we did encounter an issue Vinay responded quickly and efficiently. We usually had an online meeting to discuss the issue and demonstrate how to resolve it if it comes up in the future.

Having seen how NOT to design a syncing software, we were very pleased to see how well DBSync is designed and works.  We have received great support, especially from Gopi who has headed up our project.  So far there has not been anything we cannot do, due to a shortcoming of DBSync.  Shortcomings of Quickbooks functionality is a different story...   We&#39;re currently syncing 30 QB company files to one Salesforce org.

Everyone now has access.   Very nice!   Staff can address account issues on the fly.   \n\nNice!"

We needed a tool that would allow our 15 years of Quickbooks data to be sync\u2019d with our Salesforce account.  Going into this project, I was a bit skeptical that it was going to be as easy as others had claimed (using dbSync).  The process was easy and I\u2019m amazed! I\u2019d like to give a special thanks to Vinay.  His attentiveness and professionalism throughout the conversion process were top notch and you should be proud to have a guy like this on your staff.  Thanks again guys!"

									"response": "As a manufacturing company, we do not use Salesforce opportunities as a tool to track sales in the normal sense.  We tried Salesforce for QuickBooks for the first half of the year after implementing Salesforce (from Act) and Quickbooks (from Peachtree) and it was a nightmare.  We couldn&#39;t keep a consistent sync and no matter how hard we tried - the numbers were always off, which created a reporting nightmare for our sales team.  We finally pulled the plug and went back to the drawing board, which is where we found dbsync.\n\nWe started the process in August and I felt very comfortable with their offering and ability to work within our company&#39;s needs using out of the box and custom features.  The actual implementation was a slower than I anticipated, but we did require customization.  The customization makes the wait worth it as we&#39;ve been able to do exactly what we wanted to do.  Avinash was first point of contact and he oversaw the project right through to the end.\n\nSubhani has been our constant developer and support person.  Subhani was able to set up our sync from QB to SF and add in custom fields so that we can track total sales (even in the products weren&#39;t in the price book).  We were able to delete irrelevant fields and even back sync through 2012, which we didn&#39;t think was initially possible.  Another unique feature is that the invoice will back sync if changes have been made so it&#39;s not a one time sync - we touch our invoices 2 times in a day, so it&#39;ll sync and then update later in the day when the final shipping costs have been calculated.  All these features were well worth the small price.\n\nHonestly, the best part of all this (post implementation) has been the support that Subhani has been providing.  His response time is always within 24 hours (if not less) and he has worked with multiple members of our team whenever someone has a question.  He drew up reports for us with our specs and continues to monitor our syncing to make"

DB Sync seemed to be the logical solution to solve the dilemma of connecting Salesforce and Quickbooks. The integration process itself was quite rocky as there were incidentals that came up that were not sufficiently covered in the documentation. After some experimenting to try to get everything working, it was decided that a call to the support team at DB Sync would be the most efficacious way of getting our issue work out in an expedient manner. We were assigned to Om Mishra as our support rep for the completion of our integration. Om was responsive and accommodating despite their being a rather harsh discrepancy on hours of availability from my end. Although it took quite some time, Om was in the end able to help us resolve our problems and achieve our goal of full integration."

From there, I could sync without any problem and other time I would get \u2018Authentication Failed\u2019. Subhani at Avankia has been very helpful in assisting me to solve my integration problem between the two software. DBsync is a great programme to use and I would highly recommend it if you use Salesforce to create your sales invoices.

We finally decided to go with DBSync.\n\nIt took some time to get DBsync setup and working, mostly due to our very specific needs for custom mapping, but Raktim worked with us diligently to get it to perform as needed.  Raktim has been mentioned in other posts, and I have to agree that he has been extremely helpful and accommodating.  \n\nIf you need SF to QB integration and you need any sort of customization to work then I highly recommend this app."

We had a very customized instance of SalesForce which we wanted to sync with QuickBooks  Because we had merchant processing and a payment gateway set-up in SalesForce (Using Linvio PaymentConnect) our instance of SalesForce was very non-standard.\n\nThe only negative comment is that the front-end work - evaluating the project and projecting what the exact requirements were - was handled very briefly.  This turned out to be a problem over the course of the project, because the lead engineer (Subhani - a guy of infinite patience, and very skilled in his job) often ran into conditions in our instance that he was not aware of.\n\nFrom start-to-finish, it has taken us 6+ months to finalize - and this is where my praise has to come the highest.  Avankia and DBSync could have decided absolutely to bail-out on the project, or charge me lots more money. Instead, they remained steadfast and delivered MOST of what we asked for at the front end.  It became clear to me that for one part of the deliverable it was not reasonable to expect out of the initial, very affordable, quotation we received for the project.\n\nWe now sync an average of 60-70 orders per-day into QuickBooks, and sync the invoice data from QuickBooks back into the salesforce opportunity.  We are still ironing out a few final bugs, and the Avankia team remains responsive and professional."

We owe a special thanks to the work of Raktim Dutta for getting our company completely settled on our new Salesforce system! The sync operates smoothly in the background and couldn&#39;t be easier to operate.\n\nWould definitely recommend these providers!"

Ullas did a great job and stuck with the problem until he found out what WE had done wrong.  We fixed it in minutes and we were back and running.  Great support. \n\nI have tried 3 other Quickbooks to Salesforce integration packages before this one and this is the best.  The others simply did not work for us.  This package uses the Quickbooks Web Connector which is a Quickbooks service, not third party.  Using the Web Connector we also saved a separate integration system user license which was required for another service.  The people have been good to work with, especially Raktim Dutta who set up our database mapping.  There was a one time charge to have them set up the mapping but it was a reasonable fee given the work.  Raktim has been responsive and helpful so the mapping process has gone smoothly.  If we have problems with a sync they have always been with our data so I cannot blame them. There is a decent log for us to find the problem. \n\nI highly recommend this product, especially knowing what the others are like."

For months their support tried to fix the countless bugs but finally after 6 months they gave up and gave me back our monthly fees back to day 1. (Respectable) but in the end I needed to find a solution. I was referred to Avankia.. as the solution that would solve my headaches. \n\nWe just finished integration and while we ended up paying more for the customization, than the solutions provider who referred me to Avankia told me were included; and I had to upgrade to the Enterprise version for the customization, the shear excitement of seeing no errors in synching and all our data migrated properly,,,, WOW! \n\nAnyway I found this companies tech support to be wonderfully supportive. They are willing to show you how to migrate data and do a lot of the customization yourself. \n\nGet it all on the SOW and there should be no surprises in the sales process! \n\nPositive experience so far.. Good product... Good support.. Raghu!!!"

We will certainly strive better in the future to address our clients issue.\n\nAs of now we have almost \"twice the number\" of reviews as our nearest Salesforce & QB competitor with the highest overall rating amongst all including that of Intuits offering of 4.6 (as of today). Most of the lower reviews below have been addressed and few of those customers have come back to us, successfully using our product. \n\nSuch high numbers and ratings cannot be faked, and we must be doing something right.\n\nWe usually are challenged by the more difficult salesforce & QB integration and have become quite good at solving it. We take every review seriously and try to address the concern if we can.\n\nWith such high number of customers, we will have some un-happy customers. We try hard, unfortunately in your case we did not work harder to gain you back.\n\nWe wish you luck and best.\n\nThanks\nRajeev Gupta",

Based on our notes and records we see the following -\n\nThe product was purchased in May 2012 after a successful Trial install. You had come to us after your solution did not work with one of our competitors for over 2 years. \n\nWhen you purchase our product, we have a No Refund Policy and is stated in the agreement and our site. As a reference its at http://www.mydbsync.com/refund_cancellation_policy. \n\nIn July you reached out to us with some data sync issues, and our support engineer performed the migration and data sync for you. The case was closed on July 23rd 2012. \n\nData integration and migration can at times be challenging and you need to understand the technicalities to appreciate the efforts given by our engineers to resolve it. Our notes show that you had data issues to start with and had run the migration without taking into account existing data, and then you wanted us to fix all the issues. The migration and data issues are not part of our standard service, but still in this case we tried a level best to assist.\n\nIn most cases we charge our clients for any data synchup and migration as these are not part of our standard product offering. Its similar to Salesforce, where they provide software, but charge for implementation or migration. In your case we never charged anything for our services.\n\nWe do not have any records for any communication there after and no record or case indicating you asked for a refund or had further issues. If you have issues we are ready to assist, but we will need to know first.\n\nIn regards to renewals, we do reach out to customers in advance to start the renewal process as we do not want their service to expire.\n\nWe would certainly like to have you back as our customer and see how we can best assist you.\n\nThanks\nRajeev Gupta",

They synced a huge amount of historical data that we DID NOT ask for, which duplicated what we already had in our database.  Then I had to remain on the phone and on-line with them for hours each evening for a month, while they attempted to clean up the data as well as force data to sync that did not automatically sync.  Then they came back and told me, over a month into the process, and after our free trial time had expired, that the tool would never be able to sync our invoices correctly because of a QuickBooks issue.  We terminated the product, and asked for a refund (we had paid a year in advance).  NEVER received a response from anyone after that.  We went on to use another company&#39;s product and found out their statement our the processing of QuickBooks invoices to be untrue -- the DBSync people just evidently didn&#39;t have the communication or technical skill set to help us work around it,\n\nA YEAR later, we received an email asking if we wanted to renew our subscription.  I sent an email stating that we had terminated our service almost a year earlier, had asked for a refund and never received one, and once again requested a refund.  Funny thing, I didn&#39;t hear a word back from them --just as last year.  They&#39;re terrible at working through problems with their product."

They were able to log in and show us samples of how the app worked.  We were given clear costs on the custom build.  They followed through on everything and were very helpful with the transition. Development time was completed quickly and on time. Yes there was work involved and yes some cost too. You get what you pay for.  I expect a complete ROI within a year for the initial set up.  Ongoing subscription cost will more than pay for itself each year.  Our sync pulls information from custom fields in contracts when jobs are completed and creates and automatically creates an invoice in Quickbooks. If no customer exists then the sync will create the customer in QB from information collected from the Account in SF. It&#39;s Awesome!"

Even your team acknowledged it and released our payments after 8 months of you denying it that it is not DBSync issue.\nWe have completed your implementation and you have approved it in your Sandbox last year. The ISSUE with your Instance is that the Consulting firm you all used previously did some bad Apex programming (and cluttered your salesforce) and you don't have 75% code coverage. If your production does not have proper code coverage, it cannot push any new Apex code and since there are Apex code developed as part of your requirement in your case. We have given you what needs to be done to fix these issue (which can be done using any partner or developer who know Apex).\nAgain, as we have said earlier, we are here to help you solve your integration problem. You just need to get your production environment in shape and we can final deploy the integration that you have already approved.\nWe are more than happy to extend your license for no cost BUT, you still need to fix your production. You will have problem deploying salesforce apps using Apex because of code coverage issue.\nAgain, this is NOT a DBSync issue. The issue is your Current Production environment has low test code covereage casued by your previous Salesforce consulting firm and you should be putting your complaints to them and not to us.\nThanks\nRajeev",

But in this you overestimated the depth of the pockets of our small company. It is because of actions like this that our company has decided to dump Salesforce altogether, (Salesforce admins? You hearing this?).\nSo go peddle your 8 month installation cycles to some big companies with IT money and time to waste.",

Our company really depends upon an Order Management system and Salesforce is merely the backbone infrastructure to support that OM system. This was clearly the area Avankia had problems with as it was not strictly speaking Salesforce data.\n\nAvankia delivered it's product and it works as advertised. I am still peeved that I was forced to learn Salesforce programming to make a minor change myself that Avankia wanted thousands of dollars for.

Reason could be validation rules such as custom rules or field that does not allow empty. I don't rely 100% on the QBError as the Error field only populated if DBSync can reach to SF.

This is not a typical of our trial install.\n\nWe always recommend to our customers to have \"Free Trial\" on sandbox and test environment and not on production - this is a choice that you have as you provide us access to install the application and setup that environment. We had tried hard to address your issue spending over 6 meetings to address QuickBooks to Salesforce issues - all without any commitment from you on making a purchase.\n\nWe try our level best to make sure that the product works for your company before you make a purchasing decision. Perhaps one of the only companies to put so much energy at \"Free Trial Stage\". Many a times, the product does not work for a customer, which is fine, as atleast we know that before you make the purchase.\n\nYes, we have a very experienced support team that works from our Bangalore office, and the background noise is all the calls being made to prospects and customers to assist them from CRM to Accounting setup and issues. We do have hundreds of customers across the globe.\n\nI would request you to see this review in light of the fact that it was a \"Free Trial\" install.\n\nThanks\nRajeev Gupta",

Not only did the folks there download literally hundreds of old QuickBooks records as Opportunities (which we specifically asked them not to do), but they were grossly incompetent at trying to fix a database error. We had no fewer than five conference calls with them--sometimes lasting up to an hour each time--and they still were not able to fix the bug. In addition, it was extremely difficult to communicate with them because of the language error. I initially chose DB Sync because of the good reviews they received, but I&#39;m wondering if their quality has deteriorated lately as I noticed most of those reviews are a few years old. Whenever we had a conversation with them, it sounded like they were in a busy call center as we could hear lots of background conversations (not to mention the delay since the call was going to India).  I would be happy send you the final email we received from our contact at DB Sync, but it suffice it to say it was unprofessional, in my opinion.  He closed it out with this statement: \u201cI say you can blindly believe DBSync and move forward with it.\u201d  Needless to say, that was a pretty surprising statement after DB Sync\u2019s complete failure to sync our QuickBooks with Salesforce."

Our sync is unique where we have two branches and two QB files but the same SF.  The San Diego branch has it own products and QB while we have our products and QB file. They had to create one sync for two branches.  They were very helpful and willing to work with you. I hope this help. Good Luck!",

The tool did not work and I was unable to get any real support from the company.  \n\nI found DBSync on the appexchange.  I read the reviews and it almost sounded too good to be true.  I purchased the product and within a week DBSync was implemented, customized to my environment and was doing all it was promoted to do and more.  \n\nThe Support team at Avankia has been one of the most responsive, qualified and most pleasant support teams I have ever worked with.  I cannot say enough good things about the Support Team.\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone that is using SFDC and Quickbooks!"

As evidence please see below -\r\n\r\nOur read of this situations is that while you really liked our product, you did not have the budget to support your needs.\r\n\r\nWe have one of the most configurable QuickBooks Integration tool, specially when it comes with Salesforce. Which means we can setup most of the setups requested.\r\n\r\nIn your case you where looking for our Professional version ($795/year) which we clearly advertise that it comes with limited customizations capaibilities and is our cheapest offering. The datasheet and user guide clearly shows what the integration capabilities and we clearly show that we do not have your Estimate-to-Estimate integration. \r\n\r\nWe do not support this because most of our Professional version clients are only looking for moving Estimate from Salesforce to QuickBooks and not vice-versa. Moving from Estimates from QuickBooks to Salesforce has implications like over-writing closed won opportunities which end clients should take time understand.\r\n\r\nI do feel that my sales rep was very ethical and professional, as our records show the following -\r\n\r\n1. When you registered, you were ready to purchase. My Rep stopped you and recommended that you first try the product to make sure it fits your need. We did not require you to purchase or even commit to purchase while we answered all your questions.\r\n2. You reached out to us showing your disappointment on the feature set. I personally responded to your email clearly stating we don't support.\r\n\r\nYou certainly do have other choices and we do not force our propective customers and always try to make sure that it really makes sense for you before you buy our solution.\r\n\r\nI request you to re-consider your review as we pride ourselves to have a perfect 5/5 rating. Please feel free to reachout to us if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRajeev Gupta\r\nDBSync",

The solution comes prebuilt for many requirements, opportunity to invoice  and products to items for example, for a very reasonable price. The beauty of the solution however is in the ability to customize. For my implementation we needed to build new custom objects in sfdc to sync common quickbooks objects (bills, purchase orders) to/from sfdc. \n\nThis was the best solution for our requirements, as we used the \"out of the box\" solution for 90% of our object syncing requirements, and then customized the remaining 10%. \n\nEvery other solution that we saw was either unable to be customized as we required, or needed to be completely built from scratch, costing 5x as much in professional support.\n\nThe fact Estimate - Estimate is not included in the \"out of the box\" sync should not warrant the poor rating, as it clearly is not documented to be included in this solution out of the box.",

The new web-based administration console means you don&#39;t need to get on the computer hosing Quickbooks for every adjustment-- a huge plus for remote administration.  Most importantly, customer support has been timely and consistent.  They&#39;ve always been a great help."

In order to facilitate accurate data entry into QB, without the task of duplicate data entry, DBSYNC is the answer.\n\nIt is so easy to use, just by hitting the Generate Button in Salesforce, an invoice is automatically created in QB, thus expediting the process of sending out an invoice to the Customer.  It is a seamless process which frees up my time to concentrate on customer relationship development and management.  Now, the three remote users can access real-time information quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe set-up and configuration time was done quickly, and the technical staff went above and beyond to make sure everything worked 100%.  They were terrific and made the experience stress-free.\n\nI highly recommend DBSYNC to other users with similar challenges to operational processes, in linking Salesforce CRM information with QB Accounting."

The original version of the Sync Tool did not meet our needs because it requires all product data to be entered into Salesforce first and then Sync to QuickBooks.  Many of our products are listed in group form so it would not allow this to occur.  Avankia however was able to develop a new version that would permit us to Sync Salesforce with Quickbooks first and then allow us to add our product to the Quickbooks entry and have it captured back into Salesforce.  Avankia went above and beyond to develop a tool that would work within our environment, and worked closely with our staff to make sure all the small details that were needed to complete the process were refined.  \n\nSo, if you are looking for a product that will allow your QuickBooks Database to Sync with Salesforce.com, look no further then Avankia\u2019s DBsync."

They have given us the best customer support that I have experienced in a long time, from any industry!\n\nThe DBSync product itself has proved to be intuitive and very easy to use while still having a lot a flexibility to customize it to our particular needs. I recommend it very highly."

Simply stated DBSync worked the first time we tried it and it only took about 45 minutes from start to finish to get everything up and running. The setup basically involved adding a couple of additional fields to a few page layouts in SFDC and downloading a small synchronization application to a local PC. Now we&#39;re creating invoices in QuickBooks directly out of Opportunities in SFDC. The pre-sales technical support is first class. They are very knowledgeable and accommodating and they went out of their way to show us additional features such as the bi-directional data transfer capability which updates the payment status of the invoices from QuickBooks back to SFDC. The time saved by our accounting and sales departments on that feature alone makes this worthwhile. We&#39;ve been using QuickBooks for over 10 years and Salesforce for about 2 and our business cannot run without either system. This is the perfect way to keep our systems synchronized and have access to accurate account status. We were former Account Dynamics customers and were left hanging when they claimed to go out of business. This is a much simpler installation and the product does not require any 3rd party servers to make the connections between the two systems. This is the best solution we&#39;ve found to create invoices, sales orders or estimates from SFDC to QuickBooks."

									"response": "The DBSync solution goes one step further than the others by creating an invoice object and automatically synchronizing invoice details.  This enables salesforce.com users to have real-time insight into accounting information such as outstanding invoices, billings and payments.  Using salesforce.com roll-up summaries it&#39;s easy to create reports summarizing these metrics by account.  It also has the intelligence to automatically create new products in QuickBooks when a new invoice is sent saving us valuable time.  The interface is intuitive, allowing for easy customization of the mappings and sync intervals.  And most importantly, the synchronization itself is efficient and solid."
